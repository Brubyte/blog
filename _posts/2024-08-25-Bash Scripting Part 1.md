I started learning Bash Scripting as I wanted to improve on my skills. I started to learn it using what 
I learnt from a programming perspective.

It started with learning with what is shebang.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

```
Next it involved with learning how to print inputs using echo.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo" Hello World"
```

Also learned how to use variables in bash.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

name="Hiro"
echo $name
```
