What a Journey it has been. I have finished all the modules of the CBBH path. And best of all 
I have learned a lot when it comes to the modules, myself and what I can do to get better.

Each modules have been challenging and will really push you to think critically on how each 
vulnerability will be exploited. There were times that I was struggling and had to step back 
for each time that I start the skill assessments but everytime that I do finish it I get mindblown 
that those exploits are utilized to get to the flag.

This cbbh journey also taught about what I need to do to improve. Time to start practice some machines.

All that is left is the exam which I will take soon.
