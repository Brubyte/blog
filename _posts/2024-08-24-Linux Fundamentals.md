This time I started to learn the basic Linux Commands on TryHackMe. This helped me get familiar which commands I'll be using in the long run.

sudo - lets you perform restricted commands
ls- this lists out the files or directories in a particular system.
cat- this allows you to view contents of a file.
cd - lets you navigate between different directories.
touch-creates empty files in Linux.
echo-lets you print an output. 
mkdir-allows you to create directories.
man-allows you to view manual of certain commands.
whoami-lets you view the active useername.
ssh - lets you access the secure shell.
