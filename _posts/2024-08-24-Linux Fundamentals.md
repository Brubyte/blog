This time I started to learn the basic Linux Commands on TryHackMe. This helped me get familiar which commands I'll be using in the long run.
<br>
sudo - lets you perform restricted commands.<br>
ls- this lists out the files or directories in a particular system.<br>
cat- this allows you to view contents of a file.<br>
cd - lets you navigate between different directories.<br>
touch-creates empty files in Linux.<br>
echo-lets you print an output. <br>
mkdir-allows you to create directories.<br>
man-allows you to view manual of certain commands.<br>
whoami-lets you view the active useername.<br>
ssh - lets you access the secure shell.<br>
