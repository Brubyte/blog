For now I'm sure I want to career shift into cybersecurity.

I've also started to study notes from Mike Chapel's course to understand more of the fundamental side of Cybersecurity because some people said to not trust the Self paced course alone.

So I have to study as much as I can, each day must absorb a new topic and put effort in this.
